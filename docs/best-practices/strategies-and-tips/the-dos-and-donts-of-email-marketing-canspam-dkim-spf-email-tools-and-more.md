## **What is Email Authentication?**

Email authentication is your digital ID for emails. It’s how you prove you’re really you when sending messages.

Why care? Without it, anyone could pretend to be you. Not good.

Email authentication:

* Blocks spammers from using your name
* Gets your emails to inboxes
* Protects your brand

Three main players:

1\. **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**

SPF is your domain’s guest list. It tells email providers which servers can send emails for you.

2\. **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**

DKIM adds a digital signature. It’s like sealing an envelope – if broken, something’s off.

3\. **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)**

DMARC is the bouncer. It decides what happens to emails that fail other checks.

Here’s the catch: without proper setup, your emails might land in spam. Or not arrive at all.

> _“SPF, DKIM, and DMARC implementation keeps your emails out of spam folders.”_

Many small businesses find this technical. But it’s worth it:

* Boosts email deliverability
* Protects your domain from spammers
* Builds recipient trust

Email security matters. Over 90% of targeted attacks start with an email. About 66 million targeted Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks happen monthly.

No email authentication? You’re leaving your digital door open.

Bottom line: Email authentication is crucial for serious email marketing. It’s about protecting your brand and customers, not just following rules.



***

## **Main Email Authentication Methods**

Email authentication is your digital ID for emails. It proves you’re really you when sending messages. Here are the three main methods:

**SPF: Sender Policy Framework**

SPF is your domain’s guest list. It tells email providers which servers can send emails for you.

How it works:

1. List authorized IP addresses in DNS settings
2. Receiving server checks if the email’s from an approved IP
3. If it matches, email passes SPF check

Example SPF record:

```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:servers.mcsv.net ~all
```

This allows Google and Mailchimp servers to send emails for you.

**DKIM: DomainKeys Identified Mail**

DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails. It’s like sealing an envelope.

Setting up DKIM:

1. Generate public and private key pair
2. Keep private key secret
3. Add public key to DNS records
4. Email server uses private key to sign outgoing emails
5. Receiving servers use public key to verify signature

Example DKIM record:

```
k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDhXpjoxP3ANucOq4awUl53QXp7QSrbI2xOzSTigQ68XUi6kKifXkhL/a0GkSQ9HQm+PmvlkIC4wAyI9Cf6RW8bim80jSAeQJbGYAPyTAbxxTqu+h2deO8ffLfX2jRqAs73Jpgn3XyQSCIClUyTJQR9e0/BIwvnHQlSKJA1PcgwIDAQAB
```

This lets a specific email service send authenticated emails for your domain.

**DMARC: Domain-based Message Authentication**

DMARC is the bouncer. It decides what happens to emails that fail other checks.

Implementing DMARC:

1. Set up SPF and DKIM first
2. Create DMARC policy in DNS
3. Specify how to handle failed authentication

Basic DMARC record:

```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@yourdomain.com
```

This sends failed emails to spam and reports to the specified address.

> _“SPF, DKIM, and DMARC keep your emails out of spam folders.”_

Heads up: From February 2024, Gmail and Yahoo Mail will require email authentication. It’s not just good practice – it’s becoming a must.



***

## **Following CAN-SPAM Act Rules**

The CAN-SPAM Act is crucial for real estate agents doing email marketing. It’s not just about avoiding spam—it’s the law. Break it, and you could face fines up to $51,744 per email.

Here’s what you need to do:

1. **Be honest**: Your “From”, “To”, and “Reply-To” info must be accurate.
2. **Use clear subject lines**: Don’t mislead. Keep it real.
3. **Say it’s an ad**: If you’re selling, say so.
4. **Share your address**: Include your physical mailing address in every email.
5. **Make opting out easy**: Add a clear unsubscribe option.
6. **Honor opt-outs fast**: Respect unsubscribes within 10 business days.
7. **Know your team**: If someone else handles your emails, you’re still responsible.

Quick checklist:

| CAN-SPAM Requirement   | Your Email Checklist                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Honest header info     | ☐ From, To, Reply-To are correct     |
| Clear subject line     | ☐ Matches email content              |
| Ad disclosure          | ☐ Clearly stated if it’s an ad       |
| Physical address       | ☐ Included and valid                 |
| Unsubscribe option     | ☐ Visible and easy to use            |
| Opt-out timeframe      | ☐ Honored within 10 business days    |
| Third-party compliance | ☐ Verified if using external service |

Don’t buy email lists. It’s about building trust. Use your own contacts who want to hear from you.

> _“The CAN-SPAM Act sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.” – Federal Trade Commission_

Start clean, keep it honest, and make opting out easy. Do this, and you’ll stay legal—and keep your clients happy.

## **Email Marketing Best Practices**

Let’s look at how to make your real estate emails stand out.

**Use Email Authentication**

Email authentication is key. It helps your emails reach inboxes, not spam folders. Here’s what to do:

* Set up SPF
* Implement DKIM
* Use DMARC

These steps boost your sender reputation and get your emails delivered.

**Group Your Email List**

Don’t blast everyone with the same email. Group your list based on:

* Buyer or seller status
* Property likes
* Location interests
* Past interactions

This way, you send stuff people actually want to see.

**Make Emails Personal**

Go beyond just using names. Try:

* Mentioning past chats
* Talking about properties they liked
* Tailoring content to what they need

> _The_ [_National Association of REALTORS_](https://www.nar.realtor/)_® found that 93% of members like texting, while 89% prefer email for client chats._

**Give Useful Info**

Your emails should be helpful. Think about:

* Local market updates
* Home buying or selling tips
* Neighborhood guides
* Moving checklists

A monthly newsletter could include:

1\. Recent sales nearby

2\. Upcoming local events

3\. A cool property

4\. A quick homeowner tip

**Make Emails Mobile-Friendly**

Over 65% of emails are opened on phones. Make sure your emails look good on small screens:

* Use a single-column layout
* Keep subject lines short
* Use big, easy-to-tap buttons
* Test on different devices

**Check Emails Before Sending**

Always test your emails. Use this checklist:

* ☐ Links work
* ☐ Images load
* ☐ Personalization is right
* ☐ Subject line grabs attention
* ☐ Call-to-action is clear
* ☐ No typos or errors

> _“Email marketing has a return on investment (ROI) of $36 for every $1 spent.” – Direct Marketing Association_

Every email is a chance to show off your brand. Make it count.

## **Email Marketing Mistakes to Avoid**

Let’s dive into some email marketing blunders that can tank your real estate business:

**Don’t Buy Email Lists**

Buying email lists? Bad idea. Here’s why:

* People don’t engage
* You’ll get flagged as spam
* You might break the law

> _“Purchased lists are a recipe for disaster. The folks on there didn’t ask for your emails, so they’re more likely to hit that spam button.” – Alli Tunell, BombBomb_

Instead, grow your list organically. Stick to people who actually want to hear from you.

**Skip Spammy Words**

Want your emails to land in inboxes, not junk folders? Avoid these spam triggers:

* “Free”
* “Sale”
* “Discount”

And cool it with the ALL CAPS and !!!!!!. Spam filters hate that stuff.

**Always Allow Unsubscribes**

It’s not just polite, it’s the law. The CAN-SPAM Act says you must:

* Give people a clear way out
* Honor unsubscribe requests ASAP

Make that unsubscribe link easy to spot. It builds trust and keeps you legal.

**Get Permission First**

Don’t add people to your list without asking. That means:

* No swiping emails from websites
* No adding every business card you get
* No sneaky automatic opt-ins

Just ask folks if they want in. A small, engaged list beats a big, uninterested one any day.

**Don’t Overdo It**

Bombarding people with emails? Bad move. You’ll end up with:

* More unsubscribes
* Fewer people reading your stuff
* Spam complaints

| Email Frequency | Good                   | Bad                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1-2 per month   | Keeps you on the radar | Might miss timely stuff       |
| Weekly          | Regular touchpoints    | Some folks might get annoyed  |
| Daily           | High visibility        | People will run for the hills |

Aim for 1-2 emails a month. It’s the sweet spot between staying in touch and being a pest.

## **Checking Email Campaign Results**

Sending emails is just the start. The real work? Tracking how they perform. Here’s how to measure your campaign’s success:

**Key Metrics to Watch**

**Open Rate**: How many people opened your email. In 2021, the average was 21.5% across industries.

| Industry            | Average Open Rate |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Real Estate         | 25-30%            |
| Government          | 40.55%            |
| Vitamin Supplements | 27.34%            |

**Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: People who clicked links in your email. Aim for 2.66%, but it varies by industry (1-5%).

**Conversion Rate**: Those who took the desired action after clicking.

**Bounce Rate**: Emails that weren’t delivered. For real estate, it’s about 0.37%.

**Boosting Your Numbers**

1. **Resend to Non-Openers**: Neal Taparia increased reach by 54.7% just by resending to those who didn’t open initially.
2. **Test Delivery Times**: Lauren Hall-Stigerts says try Tuesdays after 1 PM.
3. **Segment Your List**: MailChimp found 13.07% higher open rates for segmented campaigns.
4. **Mobile Optimization**: 81% of emails are opened on mobile. Not mobile-friendly? 80% will delete.
5. **Add Video**: Enfield, CT saw 28% more click-throughs with video in their email blast.

**Tracking Tools**

Use platforms like Moosend, ActiveCampaign, or Mailchimp for built-in analytics.

Email marketing isn’t fire-and-forget. Keep testing and tweaking based on these metrics. Your future self (and wallet) will thank you.

## **Fixing Email Delivery Problems**

Email delivery issues can tank your marketing. Here’s how to fix common problems:

**1. High Bounce Rates**

Bounces happen when emails can’t reach their destination:

* Soft bounces: Temporary issues (full inbox)
* Hard bounces: Permanent problems (invalid address)

**Fix it**: Keep bounce rate under 2%. Clean your list often. Remove bad addresses and inactive subscribers. Use double opt-in for real, engaged subscribers.

**2. Spam Folder Woes**

Ending up in spam? It’s like shouting into the void.

**Fix it**:

* Avoid spam trigger words
* Balance text and images
* Use authentication methods

**3. Poor Sender Reputation**

Think of sender reputation as your email credit score. Low score? Poor deliverability.

**Fix it**:

* Start small. Email engaged subscribers first
* Stick to a schedule
* Keep spam complaints under 0.1%

**4. Authentication Issues**

Unauthenticated emails? It’s like crashing a party without an invite.

**Fix it**: Use these methods:

| Method | Purpose                | Setup                                                                             |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SPF    | Verifies sender IP     | Add to DNS: `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`                                   |
| DKIM   | Adds digital signature | Set up via email provider                                                         |
| DMARC  | Combines SPF and DKIM  | Use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc/details/how-to-setup-dmarc) for setup |

**5. Content Red Flags**

Sometimes, it’s what’s IN the email that hurts you.

**Fix it**:

* Use a personal sender address (your.name@domain.com)
* Skip URL shorteners
* Avoid ALL-CAPS subject lines

**6. Technical Hiccups**

Server issues or wrong DNS settings can trip you up.

**Fix it**:

* Check email server performance regularly
* Verify your domain in your email provider’s dashboard

Fixing delivery problems? It’s ongoing. Watch your metrics, especially deliverability score. Aim for 99%+.

## **Wrap-Up**

Email marketing packs a punch for real estate pros. Here’s why it’s still a big deal:

**Lock down your emails**: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC aren’t just fancy acronyms. They’re your ticket to the inbox. Use them.

**Get personal**: Tailor your emails. People love seeing their name in the subject line. It’s not just nice—it gets results.

**Give ’em what they want**: Every email should offer something useful. Show off properties, dish out market insights, or share tips. Be the go-to expert.

**Think small screen**: Most folks check email on their phones. Make sure your emails look good there. Keep it short and sweet.

**Numbers don’t lie**: Keep an eye on your stats. Aim high: 25%+ open rates and 2.5% click-throughs. Use these numbers to get better.

**Stay sharp**: Email marketing’s always changing. Keep learning, keep improving.

## **FAQs**

**What type of emails are prohibited by the CAN-SPAM Act real estate?**

The CAN-SPAM Act applies to ALL commercial messages in real estate. This includes property listings, market updates, open house invitations, and newsletter sign-ups.

Here’s the deal: If your email’s main goal is to promote a product or service, it’s subject to CAN-SPAM rules. And yes, this applies to both B2B and B2C emails.

What’s not allowed? Emails that:

* Use false headers or deceptive subject lines
* Don’t identify as ads
* Lack a physical address
* Don’t offer an opt-out option
* Ignore opt-out requests

> _“The CAN-SPAM Act covers all commercial messages, which the law defines as ‘any electronic mail message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service,’ including email that promotes content on commercial websites.”_

Breaking these rules? You could face a $16,000 fine per email from the FTC.

The takeaway: Follow CAN-SPAM rules for all your real estate commercial emails. It’s not just about avoiding fines—it’s about building client trust.
