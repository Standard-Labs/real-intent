# What is Consumer Intent?

Consumer intent drives online behavior in real estate. It’s why people search for properties and what they want to achieve.

Key points about consumer intent in real estate:

* It’s about understanding motivations, not just demographics
* Helps target the right audience and create relevant marketing
* Improves lead quality and boosts conversion rates
* Shapes how people search for and interact with real estate services

Types of consumer intent:

1. Informational (e.g., “How to buy a house”)
2. Navigational (e.g., “Zillow home values”)
3. Commercial (e.g., “Best real estate agents in \[city]”)
4. Transactional (e.g., “Schedule home viewing”)

| Aspect           | Impact of Consumer Intent                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Ad targeting     | More precise audience selection          |
| Content creation | Tailored to specific buyer needs         |
| Lead scoring     | Better prioritization of prospects       |
| Conversion rates | Higher relevance leads to better results |

Understanding consumer intent helps real estate pros connect with potential clients at the right time, with the right message. This is crucial in today’s digital world, where buyers often research extensively before contacting an agent.

## **What is Consumer Intent in Real Estate?**

Consumer intent in real estate is the driving force behind people’s property searches and interactions with real estate services. It’s the “why” that explains their actions on real estate websites, with agents, or when looking at listings.

Why does this matter? Because understanding consumer intent helps real estate pros:

* Target their marketing better
* Create content that clicks with potential buyers or sellers
* Get better leads and close more deals

Take Zillow, for example. They get millions of visitors each month, each with their own reason for being there.

**Types of real estate consumer intent**

Here’s a quick breakdown of the main types:

| Intent Type   | What It Means              | Example                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Informational | Just looking for info      | “How to buy a house”                 |
| Navigational  | Heading to a specific site | “Zillow home values”                 |
| Commercial    | Comparing options          | “Best real estate agents in \[city]” |
| Transactional | Ready to act               | “Schedule home viewing”              |

What shapes intent? Things like:

* Big life changes (getting married, having kids, new job in a new city)
* Money matters (better credit score, saved up for a down payment)
* What’s happening in the market (low interest rates, lots of houses for sale)

Real estate pros use this info to up their game. Zillow, for instance, has a fancy “likely-buyer propensity model” that predicts who’s most likely to buy based on what they’ve done on the site before.

By focusing on high-intent users, real estate platforms and agents can:

* Create products and AI tools for serious buyers
* Make the experience more personal
* Help guide users through the often confusing real estate process

Understanding consumer intent isn’t just about spotting potential buyers or sellers. It’s about knowing where they are in their journey and giving them what they need, when they need it.

## **Main Parts of Consumer Intent**

People search for properties for all sorts of reasons. Let’s break it down:

**Why people look for new digs**

* Moving up in the world (bigger place, nicer stuff)
* Life throws a curveball (marriage, kids, new job)
* Trying to make some cash (investment properties)
* Want the latest and greatest (energy-efficient homes, cool features)

{% hint style="info" %}
Fun fact: 8-10% of Americans pack up and move each year. That’s a lot of boxes!
{% endhint %}

**What makes people tick when house hunting**

It’s not just about the house. Here’s what’s on buyers’ minds:

* Money talks (market trends, interest rates, can I afford it?)
* Personal stuff (got a raise? Baby on the way? New yoga obsession?)
* Location, location, location (good schools, short commute, awesome coffee shop nearby)
* Gut feeling (does it feel like “home”?)

> _“Buying a home isn’t just a transaction. It’s about who you are, what you want, and how you feel.” – Transactly Team_

They nailed it. Buying a home is complicated!

**The internet changed everything:**

| Year | Home searches starting online |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| 2018 | 44%                           |
| 2020 | More (thanks, COVID)          |
| Now  | 97%                           |

These days, almost EVERYONE starts their home search online. Wild, right?

If you’re in real estate, knowing this stuff helps you give buyers what they really want.

## **Intent vs. Behavior in Real Estate**

People often say one thing and do another in real estate. Let’s look at this gap:

**Intent vs. behavior: What’s the difference?**

Intent kicks off a home search. Behavior is what actually happens.

| Intent                      | Behavior                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| “I want to buy a home”      | Making an offer             |
| “I’d love to move downtown” | Viewing downtown properties |
| “I’m thinking of selling”   | Listing the house           |

_The_ [_National Association of Realtors_](https://www.nar.realtor/) _found 82% of sellers cited life events as their reason to sell. But how many followed through?_

**Turning thoughts into action**

How can real estate pros help buyers act? Here are some ways:

1\. **Be quick**

Don’t wait to respond. Most agents take 9 tries to get a response. Be better than that.

2\. **Ask why**

Find out the real reason for moving. New job? Baby on the way? This helps you tailor your approach.

3\. **Watch for signs**

Look for online behavior that shows serious interest. Temporal found this led to 50% more meetings.

> _“Using Common Room, I know immediately when someone posts a comment on LinkedIn or a question on a community forum.” – Gozie Nwachukwu, Head of Sales Development at Temporal_

4\. **Play the long game**

Only 2% of leads buy right away. Most need months of follow-up.

5\. **Stay market-savvy**

Keep up with trends. In June 2024, homes got 2.9 offers on average, down from 3.5 in 2023. This affects buyer behavior.

**How to Spot Consumer Intent**

Spotting consumer intent in real estate is key for agents. Here’s how to notice intent signals and use tools to help:

**Ways to notice intent signals**

1. **Pre-approval status**: Ask early if buyers are pre-approved for a mortgage.
2. **Multiple showings**: Serious buyers often want to see a property more than once.
3. **Specific questions**: Listen for detailed questions about costs, safety, and features.
4. **Current living situation**: Buyers selling their home or ending a lease soon may be more motivated.
5. **Market knowledge**: Serious buyers often know local prices and availability.
6. **Follow-up communication**: Buyers who reach out after a showing are showing interest.
7. **Working with one agent**: Committed buyers usually stick with one agent.

**Tools for finding consumer intent**

Real estate pros can use these tools to track consumer intent:

| Tool Type               | Purpose                          | Example                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CRM Software            | Manage leads, track interactions | [Zurple](https://zurple.com/)                                                             |
| Lead Management         | Categorize leads by intent       | CRM platforms with labeling                                                               |
| Website Analytics       | Track online behavior            | [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/)                 |

| Social Media Monitoring | Observe interactions on listings | [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/), [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/)       |

**Using CRM effectively**:

CRMs are powerful for spotting intent. The NAR’s 2022 Technology Survey found CRMs among the top three tools for quality leads.

To get the most from your CRM:

* Label contacts by intent and engagement
* Set up automated follow-ups for high-intent leads
* Analyze reports to spot buyer behavior patterns

This real-time monitoring helps you quickly spot and respond to potential buyers showing strong intent.

## **Using Consumer Intent to Find Leads**

Real estate agents can use consumer intent data to find and nurture high-quality leads. Here’s how:

**Ways to use intent information**

1. **Segment leads in your CRM**: Group contacts by intent and engagement. This helps you prioritize follow-ups.
2. **Set up automated alerts**: Get notified when leads show high-intent behaviors, like multiple property views.
3. **Create targeted email campaigns**: Develop emails for specific intents, like first-time homebuyers.
4. **Monitor search behavior**: Use tools to spot potential clients based on their search queries.
5. **Analyze website interactions**: Track how leads use your site, noting which pages they visit.

**Customizing marketing based on intent**

| Intent Type   | Marketing Approach        | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Informational | Educational content       | Local market blog posts      |
| Navigational  | Local search optimization | Neighborhood profiles        |
| Commercial    | Comparison tools          | Property feature lists       |
| Transactional | Clear calls-to-action     | “Schedule a Viewing” buttons |

To make the most of intent data:

1. **Craft personalized outreach**: Use a lead’s interests to tailor your messages. If they’re looking at family homes, mention nearby schools.
2. **Develop intent-based content**: Create resources for specific concerns, like home staging guides or first-time buyer checklists.
3. **Use retargeting ads**: Show relevant properties to leads who’ve visited your website.
4. **Implement chatbots**: Add a chatbot to engage visitors 24/7 and capture lead information.
5. **Offer virtual tours**: For high-intent leads who can’t visit in person, provide interactive virtual property tours.

By focusing on intent, you’ll create a more efficient lead generation process. The goal? Reach out to potential clients at the right time with the right message.

> _“People do not want to be sold to anymore. They want to choose a Realtor because they know and like them already.”_

This quote nails it. Build relationships through helpful, intent-based marketing instead of pushy sales tactics.

## **Problems with Understanding Intent**

Real estate agents often struggle to grasp consumer intent. Let’s look at some common issues and solutions:

**Misreading intent signals**

Agents make these mistakes when interpreting buyer intentions:

* Thinking all online leads are ready to buy
* Overlooking potential clients in the awareness stage
* Misinterpreting property searches

**Fixing intent-based lead problems**

Here’s how to improve your understanding of consumer intent:

1\. **Use a CRM system**

Track and analyze lead behavior with tech. A good CRM offers:

| Benefit              | Impact                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Lead organization    | Better prioritization         |
| Automated follow-ups | Timely communication          |
| Data analysis        | Improved intent understanding |

2\. **Create a sales pipeline**

Map your client’s journey from awareness to post-sale.

3\. **Nurture leads**

Provide value at every stage, especially for new leads.

4\. **Communicate better**

Keep clients in the loop and document key discussions.

5\. **Review sales feedback**

Regularly check in with your sales team to understand buyer preferences.

## **What’s Next for Consumer Intent in Real Estate**

The real estate industry is about to see big changes in how it understands and uses consumer intent. Here’s what’s coming:

**New ways to analyze intent**

AI and machine learning are going to shake things up:

**Predictive analytics**: By 2026, real estate tech could hit $2 trillion. This means better tools to predict what buyers will do.

**Web3 apps**: By the end of 2024, over 100 million people might use Web3 apps. This will give us new ways to understand buyers in decentralized markets.

**AI-powered insights**: AI could boost real estate productivity by over 30% by 2035, says McKinsey. This includes:

| AI Use                      | What It Does                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Natural language processing | Understands buyer messages                          |
| Computer vision             | Figures out what properties people like from images |
| Predictive modeling         | Guesses future buying patterns                      |

**Better CRM for tracking intent**

CRM systems are getting smarter at using intent data:

1\. **Real-time intent tracking**

CRMs will soon show buyer actions across platforms instantly. Agents can react fast to changing minds.

2\. **AI-driven lead scoring**

Smart algorithms will score leads based on things like:

* How they act online
* What properties they look at
* How often they communicate
* What they do on social media

3\. **Personalized outreach**

CRMs will suggest how to talk to each lead based on their signals. For example, sending virtual tours to people who spend a lot of time online.

4\. **Intent-based automation**

Future CRMs will do tasks based on what they think buyers want. If someone likes a neighborhood, it might send them listings there automatically.

5\. **Cross-platform intent analysis**

CRMs will use data from many places to understand buyer intent:

| Where data comes from | What it tells us                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Property websites     | Saved searches, favorite listings                     |
| Social media          | Where people want to live, big life changes           |
| Email                 | What listings people click on                         |
| Website behavior      | What types of properties people spend time looking at |

Real estate pros need to keep up with these changes. As Geoff De Weaver, CEO of [Limitless USA](https://limitlessusa.com/), says:

> _“The future of real estate is all about personalization. If you can tailor experiences, you’ll build relationships that last a lifetime with your clients.”_
