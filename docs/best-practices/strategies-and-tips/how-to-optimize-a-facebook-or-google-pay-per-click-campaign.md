## **1. PPC Basics**

PPC (Pay-Per-Click) is a digital ad model where you only pay when someone clicks your ad. It’s a smart way for real estate pros to get their listings in front of active property seekers.

**What is PPC?**

PPC ads appear at the top, bottom, or banner of search results pages. You’ll find them on Google, Bing, Amazon, Yahoo, and Yelp. The best part? You only pay for clicks, making it cost-effective for lead generation.

**Main Parts of PPC Campaigns**

A solid PPC campaign has four key elements:

1. **Keywords**: Search terms for your ad
2. **Ad Text**: Your quick sales pitch
3. **Targeting**: Who sees your ad and where
4. **Budget Control**: Your spending limit

&#x20;**Facebook vs. Google PPC**

Both platforms can boost your real estate business, but they serve different purposes:

| Feature     | Google Ads                    | Facebook Ads                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| User Intent | High (active search)          | Low (browsing)               |
| Ad Format   | Mainly text                   | Visual (images, video)       |
| Targeting   | Keyword-based                 | Interest and demographic     |
| Cost        | Higher ($2.37 avg. per click) | Lower                        |
| Best For    | Lead generation               | Brand awareness, retargeting |

Google Ads work best when people are actively house-hunting. Someone searching “homes for sale in \[your city]” is likely ready to buy. Facebook Ads are great for building your brand and reaching potential future buyers.

> _“PPC advertising is becoming increasingly popular among real estate businesses due to its high ROI and its ability to attract prospects who are already far along in the buyer’s journey.”_

## **2. Setting Campaign Goals**

Want your PPC campaigns to succeed? Set clear goals. It’s that simple. Here’s how to do it for Facebook or Google:

**2.1 Choosing Main Goals**

Pick goals that make sense for your business. Some common ones:

* More website visitors
* More leads
* More sales
* Better brand awareness

Let’s say you’re a realtor. Your goal? Get more property inquiries.

**2.2 Picking Key Metrics**

Got your main goal? Great. Now choose metrics to track it. Here are some PPC metrics you’ll want to know:

| Metric                    | What It Measures                   | Why It Matters                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR)  | % who click after seeing your ad   | Shows if your ad grabs attention                         |
| Conversion Rate           | % of clicks that become actions    | Tells you if your ad and landing page work well together |
| Cost Per Click (CPC)      | What you pay for each click        | Helps you manage your budget                             |
| Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) | Money made per dollar spent on ads | Shows if your campaign is profitable                     |

For our realtor example? Focus on conversion rate and cost per lead.

**2.3 Matching Goals with Marketing Plans**

Make sure your PPC goals fit your overall marketing strategy. It keeps your message consistent.

How to do it:

* Use similar messages in PPC ads and other marketing
* Target keywords that match your marketing themes
* Set PPC budgets that fit your overall marketing spend

As your business grows, your goals might change. You might start with brand awareness, then move to driving sales.

> _“The average click-through rate typically falls between 4-6%, with a CTR of 7-9% considered above average.”_

Use this to set realistic CTR goals for your campaigns.

## **3. Keyword Research**

Keyword research can make or break your PPC campaigns. Here’s how to nail it:

**3.1 Keyword Research Tools**

Three tools to supercharge your keyword game:

1. [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/tools/keyword-planner/): Free, shows search volume and competition.
2. [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/): Paid, offers keyword magic and PPC keyword tools.
3. [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/): Massive database of 20.4 billion keywords across 216 locations.

**3.2 Long vs. Short Keywords**

Short keywords cast a wide net. Long keywords? They’re your sharpshooters.

<table><thead><tr><th width="151">Keyword Type</th><th width="128">Example</th><th width="145">Search Volume</th><th>Competition</th><th>Conversion Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Short</td><td>Boots</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Lower</td></tr><tr><td>Long</td><td>Brown women’s ankle boots</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Higher</td></tr></tbody></table>

For real estate, long keywords shine. “3 bedroom house for sale in \[City]” beats “house for sale” any day.

**3.3 Negative Keywords**

Negative keywords are your PPC bodyguards. They keep the riffraff out and your targeting on point.

How to use them:

1. Scan Google’s search terms report for words to block.
2. Use Google Ads Keyword Planner to spot potential troublemakers.
3. Add negatives at campaign or ad group level.

Realtor selling houses? Add “rent” as a negative. No more wasted clicks from renters.

> _“Negative keywords are like bouncers for your PPC ads. They keep the wrong crowd out and let the right ones in.”_

_Pro tip: Keep your keyword list fresh. It’s not set-it-and-forget-it. It’s a living, breathing part of your campaign._

## **4. Writing Good Ad Text**

PPC success hinges on attention-grabbing, click-driving ad text. Here’s the lowdown:

**4.1 Parts of Good Ad Text**

A killer PPC ad has these must-haves:

| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Headline       | 30 chars (x3)   | Grab attention, use keywords    |
| Description    | 90 chars (x2)   | Highlight benefits, add details |
| Display URL    | 35 chars        | Show relevance, build trust     |

For real estate, try these headline zingers:

* “3-Bed \[City] Home from $X”
* “Hot Off the Market: \[Neighborhood] Dream Home”
* “Hunting for a \[Area] Family Pad?”

**4.3 Clear and Brief Descriptions**

Your description should build on your headline and push for action:

* Spotlight benefits, not just features
* Use action words to light a fire

Like this:

> _“Roomy 3-bed with slick kitchen. Schools and parks nearby. Schedule your tour now!”_

_Pro tip: Your ad copy should mirror your landing page. This boosts your Quality Score and conversion rates._

Bonus: Use ad extensions for extra info without cluttering your main ad. Phone numbers, location details, and site links can juice up engagement without hogging your character count.

> _“Even non-text ads need solid copy. Every word counts, no matter the format.” – K6 Agency_
