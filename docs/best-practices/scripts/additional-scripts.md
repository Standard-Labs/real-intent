### Guide for Crafting Scripts

**Formula Breakdown:**

1. Personalized Comment: Reference something specific to the recipient (their home, neighborhood trends, or online platforms like Zillow).
2. Engagement: Ask a simple, open-ended question to prompt thought and encourage interaction.
3. Curiosity: Use a thought-provoking line or scenario that positions you as interested but not pushy.
4. Casual Closing: Keep the ending light and open (e.g., “When’s a good time to talk?” or “Let me know if this resonates.”).

**Subject Line Strategy:**

1. Evoke Curiosity: "What Zillow won’t tell you about your home."
2. Personalization: "Thought about \[Neighborhood/Area] lately?"
3. Exclusive or Intriguing Tone: "Could your home spark a bidding war?"
4. Relevant Hook: "Here’s what your neighbors are talking about…"

### Follow-Up Strategy

**Timing**:

* First follow-up: 24-48 hours after the initial message.
* Second follow-up: 5-7 days after first follow-up.
* Final follow-up: 2 weeks later with a light touch.

**Tone**:

* Friendly and non-intrusive.
* Restate curiosity and open the door for a response.
* Avoid repetition—bring a new angle to each follow-up.

**Examples**:

1. **Follow-Up 1:**\
   &#xNAN;_"Hi \[Name], just wanted to make sure you saw my last message. I’d love to hear your thoughts on \[Neighborhood/Area]—no rush, just whenever you have a minute!"_
2. **Follow-Up 2:**\
   &#xNAN;_"Hey \[Name], I noticed another interesting trend in \[Neighborhood/Area] this week. Thought of you again and wanted to share—have a quick minute to chat?"_
3. **Follow-Up 3:**\
   &#xNAN;_"Hi \[Name], I’ll leave you alone after this, I promise! Just wanted to let you know I’m here if you ever want to talk about \[Neighborhood/Area] or explore what’s possible for your home."_
