# Approach Scripts

### **Script 1: Finding a Home for Buyers**

_“Hello, I am calling everyone in your immediate area to find a home for our buyers, \[Buyer’s First Name] and \[Buyer’s First Name]. They have seen everything available on the open market and have hired us to think outside of the box and reach out to the community for help. Have you or any of your neighbors thought about selling your home?”_

This script is a personable and engaging way to address a need for housing in the neighborhood. By reaching out with specific buyers in mind, you position yourself as a proactive, solution-focused agent.

### **Script 2: Complimentary Home Value Assessment**

_“Hi, this is \[Your Name] from \[Your Agency]. We’re offering complimentary home value assessments in your area. Would you be interested in scheduling a quick assessment?”_

Offering a free home value assessment provides immediate value to homeowners. According to real estate data, most homeowners would consider selling if they had a clear understanding of their property’s current worth, making this a valuable approach for sparking initial interest.

### **Script 3: Exclusive Buyer Incentive**

_“Hello, this is \[Your Name] with \[Your Agency]. We have an exclusive incentive for buyers in your neighborhood, including a special financing program and reduced closing costs. Do you or anyone you know have an interest in buying or selling a home in the near future?”_

In this script, an incentive for buyers, such as reduced closing costs, can attract both new clients and referrals. This outreach can appeal to leads who may be hesitating due to financing or closing costs.

### **Script 4: New Listing Alert**

_“Hello, this is \[Your Name] with \[Your Agency]. I wanted to inform you of some new listings that have come on the market in your neighborhood. These homes are generating a lot of interest, and they may sell quickly. Can I provide you with more details?”_

Keeping clients informed about new listings in their area positions you as an in-the-know, resourceful agent. Since many homeowners are curious about local listings, this approach taps into that interest, helping you build rapport and drive engagement.

### Conclusion

Using targeted scripts and timing can lead to big results, with research showing that real estate professionals who reach out at optimal times—such as between 10–11 AM or 4–5:30 PM—see up to a 30% increase in call engagement rates. Adding value-driven outreach boosts connection potential, with 74% of clients preferring personalized follow-ups over generic pitches. By combining these insights with community-focused messages, you’ll keep yourself top-of-mind and increase conversions.&#x20;
