# How Intent Data Reveals Your Buyer's Decision-Making Style

The divide between emotional and practical decision-makers manifests in fascinating ways through digital behavior. Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reveals that 43% of buyers are influenced by emotional factors like aesthetics and neighborhood charm, while 57% prioritize practical considerations like investment potential and property specifications.

“A home purchase is often 50% emotional and 50% financial,” says Jessica Lautz, Vice President of Demographics and Behavioral Insights at NAR. “Understanding which factors resonate most with a buyer allows agents to position properties in a way that’s tailored to their decision-making style.”

A practical buyer might methodically compare square footage costs across neighborhoods, showing markedly different digital patterns from someone who spends hours virtually walking through a property’s garden at sunset. These behavioral contrasts offer crucial insights into how to frame property discussions.

Decision pattern analysis reveals that emotional buyers often exhibit a non-linear search journey. Practical buyers typically follow a systematic property evaluation process, while emotional decision-makers frequently circle back to properties that spark connection, regardless of how well they match their stated criteria. NAR’s data supports this, showing that emotional buyers often revisit listings three times more frequently than their practical counterparts.

The timing and duration of property interactions tell a compelling story about decision-making style. Practical buyers tend to conduct research during traditional hours, following a structured approach, while emotional buyers often engage in late-night virtual tours or repeated viewings of the same spaces, indicating a more personal connection to properties.

### **Tailoring Communication Strategies**

Content consumption patterns provide clear signals about buyer motivation. Practical decision-makers gravitate toward market analysis reports, investment calculations, and neighborhood statistics. In contrast, emotional buyers spend more time with lifestyle imagery, virtual tours, and narrative property descriptions, helping agents calibrate their communication approach.

According to Zillow’s 2023 Consumer Housing Trends Report, 54% of buyers rely on visual content as a deciding factor, with emotional buyers spending an average of 10% more time engaging with lifestyle and neighborhood visuals than practical buyers. The sequence of property exploration also reveals fundamental differences in priorities. Practical buyers typically start with price points and investment potential, while emotional buyers often begin with aesthetic features or lifestyle elements. Understanding these entry points helps agents structure property presentations more effectively.

Modern intent tracking can distinguish between analytical and intuitive property evaluation styles. When a buyer spends more time with spreadsheets and market comparisons than virtual tours, it signals a need for data-driven communication. Conversely, high engagement with emotional touchpoints suggests a need for narrative-focused presentation.

Cross-platform behavior offers insights into decision-making complexity. Practical buyers often maintain consistent search criteria across platforms, while emotional buyers show more variability in their property interests, reflecting the influence of mood and inspiration on their search process.

The velocity of decision-making provides crucial context. Practical buyers typically maintain steady, measured evaluation patterns, while emotional buyers show more rapid shifts in interest levels and property preferences. This pattern was highlighted in a study by Realtor.com, which found that emotionally driven buyers make purchase decisions 35% faster when they find properties that match their aesthetic preferences. These insights help agents pace their engagement and communication accordingly.

### **Success Stories Using Buyer Behavior Analysis**

1. **Case Study: Streamlined Communication with CRM Systems**\
   Coldwell Banker utilized their CRM to track client communication patterns and identify peak engagement times. They found that clients who opened emails late in the evening often displayed more emotional decision-making traits, favoring properties with strong lifestyle elements. By adjusting follow-up times to match these patterns, Coldwell Banker saw a 20% increase in appointment bookings, reaching buyers when their interest was highest.
2. **Using Heatmaps to Identify Key Property Features**\
   Century 21 implemented heatmap software to analyze buyer behavior on their website. They discovered that buyers repeatedly viewed specific elements, such as garden photos and kitchen renovations, more than others. This data allowed Century 21 to spotlight these features in follow-up emails, which resulted in 18% higher engagement and faster response times, especially among emotionally driven buyers.
3. **Optimizing Responses with Email Analytics**\
   By analyzing email open rates and click-through data, Keller Williams tailored their follow-ups based on buyer interest patterns. For example, practical buyers responded better to emails containing market comparisons, while emotional buyers engaged more with lifestyle-driven content. Keller Williams achieved a 15% increase in conversion rates by aligning follow-up content with buyer behavior.
