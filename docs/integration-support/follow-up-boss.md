Hereâ€™s a complete guide for retrieving and storing your API key in Follow Up Boss:

### Retrieving Your Follow Up Boss API Key

1. **Log into Your Follow Up Boss Account**
   * Open [Follow Up Boss](https://www.followupboss.com/) in your browser.
   * Enter your login credentials and sign in.
2. **Access the Admin Panel**
   * Once logged in, navigate to the **Admin** section, which youâ€™ll find on the left sidebar.
3. **Go to API Key Management**
   * In the Admin section, select **API** from the available options.
   * Here, youâ€™ll see the option to generate or view API keys. If you already have an API key, it will be listed here.
4. **Generate a New API Key** (If Needed)
   * If you donâ€™t have an API key, click on the **Generate New API Key** button.
   * Follow Up Boss will create a new API key specifically for your account.
5. **Copy the API Key**
   * Once generated, copy the API key. This is a unique key tied to your account, allowing you to connect Follow Up Boss with other applications.
6. **Integrate Your API Key with Real Intent**
   * Provide us your API Key by sending it to your salesperson or at <mark style="color:purple;">contact@realintent.co</mark>.\


### Storing Your Follow Up Boss API Key Securely

1. **Choose a Secure Storage Location**
   * Use a password manager like [1Password](http://1password.com/) or [LastPass](http://lastpass.com/) to store your API key. This keeps it safe and accessible only to authorized users.
2. **Restrict Access**
   * Only share API keys with trusted individuals who need access to the integrations. If youâ€™re working with a team, consider setting up role-based access within Follow Up Boss.
3. **Regularly Review and Rotate API Keys**:
   * Periodically review your API keys to see if theyâ€™re still in use. For security, rotate your API keys every few months. You can generate a new key in Follow Up Boss and update any integrated systems with this new key.
4. **Monitor Activity Logs**:
   * Follow Up Boss includes an Activity Log in the Admin panel, which logs access and actions. Regularly review this log to ensure no unauthorized access has been made with your API key.

_If you suspect your API key has been exposed or compromised, return to the API Key section in the Admin panel, delete the old key, and generate a new one. Update all integrations to use the new key._
