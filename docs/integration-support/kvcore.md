### Storing Your kvCORE Parse Email Securely

1. **Choose a Secure Storage Location**
   * Use a password manager like [**1Password**](http://1password.com/) or [**LastPass**](http://lastpass.com/) to store your parse key. This keeps it safe and accessible only to authorized users.
2. **Restrict Access**
   * Make sure that only team members who need the parse key for integrations have access to it. In kvCORE, you can set user permissions to limit who can view your parse email.
3. **Regularly Review and Update**
   * Periodically check your kvCORE account for any changes in API keys, parse keys, and update documentation or storage accordingly.
4. **Security Tip**
   * Do not share the your parse key over email or unsecured channels. Use a secure file-sharing service or password manager.
